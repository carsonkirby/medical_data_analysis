# Medical Data Analysis ðŸ©º

## Project Details ðŸ“œ
#### The medical data analysis application was a project I built in Python for my Computational Thinking class. The goal of the application is to return a graphic and text output to explain factors that impact the likelihood of heart attacks. The applications uses the input heart.csv. This file contains information about indiviuals such as their age, whether they have had a heart attack, and other health measures. 

## Example Output:
#### The following visualizations are examples of the output this application should produce. The pie chart shows the ratio of heart attacks that occur in males vs. females. The bar chart shows the percent of indiviuals who had a heart attack based on their resting EKG classification. EKG is a measure of how fast an indiviual's heart is beat and the elctrical signals passing through the heart.

## What I Learned ðŸ“š
#### There were several new skills I learned when completing this project. The project allowed me to become familiar with the Pandas library, a tool that was instrumental in the data analysis executed in this project. I learned how to use matplot.lib, allowing me to create pie chart and bar graph visualizations to better display the data I worked with. 


## How to Run the Program ðŸ’»
#### 1. Clone this repository on your local machine or just download the heart.csv file, medical_analysis_main.py, and utilities.py file.
#### 2. Open a Python terminal. I use a program called Spyder through Anconda Navigator.
#### 3. Ensure that the CSV file and both Python files are in the same directory or folder. 
#### 4. Run the medical_analyis_main.py file
#### 5. The text outputs will be printed in the terminal 
#### 6. The graphic outputs will also appear. These can be saved as PNG files for further analysis.
